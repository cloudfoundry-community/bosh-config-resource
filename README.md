# BOSH Config Resource

A resource that will allow updating cloud and runtime configs using the [BOSH CLI v2](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html).

## Adding to your pipeline

To use the BOSH Deployment Resource, you must declare it in your pipeline as a resource type:

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: bosh-config
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: cfcommunity/bosh-config-resource
```

## Source Configuration

* `target`: *Optional.* The address of the BOSH director which will be used for the deployment. If omitted, target_file
  must be specified via out parameters, as documented below.
* `client`: *Required.* The username or UAA client ID for the BOSH director.
* `client_secret`: *Required.* The password or UAA client secret for the BOSH director.
* `ca_cert`: *Required.* CA certificate used to validate SSL connections to Director and UAA. If omitted, the director's
  certificate must be already trusted.
* `config`: *Required.* Type of config to update.
* `name`: *Optional.* Property for named-configs. If omitted, will default to `default`.


### Example

``` yaml
- name: staging
  type: bosh-config
  source:
    target: https://bosh.example.com:25555
    client: admin
    client_secret: admin
    ca_cert: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
    config: cloud
    name: my-named-config
```

## Behaviour

### `in`: Download most recent config from BOSH director

This will download the config manifest. It will place two files in the target directory:

- `{cloud,runtime}-config.yml`: The config manifest
- `version`: The sha1 of the config manifest

_Note_: Only the most recent version is fetchable

### `out`: Update config on BOSH director

This will upload any given stemcells and releases, lock them down in the
deployment manifest and then deploy.

#### Parameters

* `manifest`: *Required.* Path to a BOSH config manifest file.
* `releases`: Array of paths to bosh releases to upload

``` yaml
# Update config
- put: staging
  params:
    manifest: path/to/manifest.yml
    releases:
      - path/to/first/release
      - path/to/second/release
```
